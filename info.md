## Bihar Assembly Elections 2025: Comprehensive Research Report & Dashboard Data Package

Hey Kethan! I've completed an in-depth analysis of the Bihar Assembly Elections November 2025 and prepared a comprehensive data package for your web dashboard. Here's everything you need:

### 🎯 Executive Summary

The **National Democratic Alliance (NDA)** swept the Bihar Assembly Elections 2025 with a historic landslide victory, securing **202 out of 243 seats** (83%) — their best performance since 2010.

**Key Highlights:**
- **BJP** emerged as the single largest party for the first time in Bihar with **89 seats** (88.1% strike rate)

- Record **67.13% voter turnout** — highest in Bihar's electoral history
- **Female turnout at 71.78%** vs male 62.98% — a decisive 9% gender gap that favored NDA

***

### 🎭 Caste & Demographics Analysis

**Bihar Caste Demographics** (2023 Bihar Caste Survey):
- **Extremely Backward Classes (EBC)**: 36.01% (112 sub-castes)
- **Other Backward Classes (OBC)**: 27.12% (Yadav, Kurmi, Koeri, Kushwaha, etc.)
- **Scheduled Castes (SC)**: 19.65%
- **Scheduled Tribes (ST)**: 1.68%
- **General/Upper Castes**: 15.38% (Brahmin, Bhumihar, Rajput, Kayastha)

**Caste Politics Impact:**

The **2025 election marked a dramatic shift** from the traditional "M-Y" (Muslim-Yadav) formula that powered RJD for decades to a new "M-E" equation:
- **M** = Mahila (Women)
- **E** = EBC (Extremely Backward Classes)

**NDA's Winning Caste Coalition:**
- **BJP**: Upper castes (Brahmin, Bhumihar, Rajput) + Non-Yadav OBCs
- **JD(U)**: EBCs (36% of population) + Kurmi-Koeri (Luv-Kush bloc)
- **LJP(RV)**: Dalits/Paswans (consolidated Scheduled Caste support)
- **HAM(S)**: Mahadalits
- **RLM**: Kushwahas

**MGB's Failed Strategy:**
- Over-reliance on Yadav-Muslim base (couldn't expand beyond core 23% vote)
- Lost EBC consolidation battle to Nitish Kumar
- AIMIM split Muslim votes (won 5 seats, mostly from MGB share)
- Dalit voters shifted to NDA allies

***

### 🌍 Regional Performance

**NDA Dominated Across Regions:**

| Region | NDA Performance | MGB Performance | Key Features |
|--------|----------------|-----------------|--------------|
| **Mithilanchal (North)** | Strong | Weak | Traditional NDA stronghold |
| **Kosi (Northeast)** | Very Strong | Weak | High female turnout favored NDA |
| **Seemanchal** | Mixed | Moderate | 24 Muslim-dominated seats, AIMIM impact |
| **Tirhut (Central)** | Strong | Weak | Mixed caste demographics |
| **Bhojpur (South-Central)** | Strong | Weak | Close contests, <100 vote margins |
| **Magadh (South)** | Strong | Weak | NDA swept most seats |
| **Patna Region** | Dominant | Weak | BJP/JDU dominated urban centers |

***

### 🔑 Key Factors Behind NDA Victory

**1. Women Voter Mobilization**
- Historic 71.78% female turnout (vs 62.98% male) created a decisive 9-point gender gap
- **Mukhyamantri Mahila Rojgar Yojana** (Rs 10,000 scheme launched in Sept 2025) resonated strongly
- Women credited welfare schemes for their loyalty

**2. EBC Consolidation**
- EBCs constitute 36% of Bihar's population (from 2023 caste survey)
- Nitish Kumar (Kurmi community) successfully consolidated EBC support
- Contrasted sharply with RJD's narrow Yadav-Muslim base

**3. Nitish Kumar Factor**
- Despite anti-incumbency and flip-flop criticism, Nitish's governance record held
- JD(U)'s remarkable turnaround: 43 seats (2020) → 85 seats (2025)
- Infrastructure development and welfare schemes paid dividends

**4. BJP's Expansion**
- First time BJP emerged as single largest party in Bihar assembly
- Consolidated upper caste + Non-Yadav OBC + youth votes
- Strong organizational machinery and PM Modi's charisma

**5. Chirag Paswan's Strategic Win**
- LJP(RV) won 19/28 seats (65.5% strike rate)
- Consolidated Dalit/Paswan votes effectively
- Validated NDA alliance strategy

**6. Unemployment Narrative Failed**
- Despite 9.6% urban unemployment (5th highest in India), jobs issue didn't translate to votes
- Voters cited "fatigue" with unfulfilled promises
- Other factors (caste, welfare, identity) dominated inside polling booths

**7. Youth Vote Fragmentation**
- MGB expected youth consolidation around unemployment issue
- Instead, youth votes fragmented across NDA, MGB, Jan Suraaj, and AIMIM
- Urban/semi-urban youth leaned toward NDA in Patna, Muzaffarpur, Bhagalpur

***

### 📉 Why Mahagathbandhan Failed

**1. RJD's Narrow Base**
- Despite highest vote share (23%), couldn't convert to seats
- Over-dependent on Yadav-Muslim consolidation (which didn't materialize fully)
- Failed to expand beyond traditional 23% ceiling

**2. Congress Collapse**
- From 19 seats (2020) to just 6 seats (2025)
- Vote share dropped from 9.48% to 8.71%
- Weak grassroots organization in Bihar

**3. AIMIM Factor**
- Owaisi's AIMIM won 5 seats, mostly in Muslim-dominated constituencies
- Split Muslim votes that would have gone to MGB
- NDA also made inroads in Muslim-heavy seats

**4. Anti-Incumbency Didn't Work**
- Despite 20 years of Nitish Kumar governance, voters gave him another mandate
- Welfare schemes and development outweighed incumbency fatigue

**5. Prashant Kishor's Jan Suraaj**
- Divided opposition votes in 35 constituencies where margin < winning margin
- Though won zero seats, impacted MGB negatively
